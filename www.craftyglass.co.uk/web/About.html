    <p class="whiteText">During the process of writing this short introduction, I suddenly became aware that my love of stained glass predates, by some considerable time, any thoughts of producing any pieces myself. In fact, while searching through the wealth of photographs I could possibly use on the site, one could be forgiven for thinking that half my holidays were spent in churches and cathedrals. Clearly time well spent, but what is the fascination?</p>
    <p class="whiteText">Speaking for myself, life appears to stand still as I gaze in wonder at the beauty of the illumination on a bright summers day. Rich reds contrasted against deep blues and subtle yellows. Simple though expressive painted faces
    succinctly illustrating all aspects of the meaning of faith. Reflected light cast across the textured stone floors. In short, a  masterclass in the simple but effective use of light. </p>
    <p class="whiteText">The logical progression is to try and create some myself. Of course, and there is a distinction, not so much stained glass, but leaded lights. The problem being I had absolutely no idea how to do it or what it entailed. So, I signed up for a course at the Rainbow Studios in Stoke Newington in north London. Incidentally, I have written a review of the course, which you can read by clicking here.</p>
    <p class="whiteText">While the course I attended focused on the use of lead came, it obviously covered how to cut glass.  Once mastered, I felt confident to try out other techniques, such as copper foil method. The technical aspects of this I learned using the wealth of material available on 'Youtube' together with a lot of practice. You can find some links to the most useful videos here. </p>
    <p class="whiteText">My final consideration and arguably the most important, was where I was going to create my glass and what tools and materials I would need. All of which are covered here.</p>
    <p class="whiteText">The aim of this site is not to promote myself as an expert on stained glass; on the contrary, it is to share my journey so far and to draw together the myriad of resources and sources of advice that I have ploughed through until I finally understood what I really needed and where I could find it. I hope you find my little space on the Internet both enjoyable and informative.</p>
